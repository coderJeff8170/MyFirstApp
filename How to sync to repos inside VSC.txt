1. Find or create Repository in the Cloud (Github). Don't forget to check the readme file box.

2. Create work folder in local computer, ideally with same name.

3. Initialize git on work folder: type "git init" in terminal. 

    Make sure you're in the work folder that you want to sync.
    This will create a hidden .git file that holds the information git needs to sync to your repo.
    if you screw up and init the wrong folder, you may see a crapload of files unstaged in your IDE.
    Fear not! Go to terminal, navigate to the folder and type "rm -rf .git" - this will remove the git configuration file, causing your ide to stop tracking the files you didn't mean to track,
    and more importantly, they will no longer annoyingly show up in your IDE.
    Be careful using the rm (remove) command, especially with the tags -rf (recursively and with force- reaching into subdirectories and ignoring safety prompts)
    make sure that .git is what you type afterward, as it will erase any file you name - you only want it to do that to the .git file.
    Make sure you're in a directory that you want to link to a repo, and try again.

4. Sync - type "git remote add origin (paste link to cloud repo here)"

5. git pull origin master - this will pull any files in the cloud (the readme) into your local synced folder.

6. Start working. Create file, stage, commmit, push.

7. Make sure to pull before you start working, and push when you're done.
